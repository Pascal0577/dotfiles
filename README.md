# dotfiles
Simple dotfiles for Hyprland that I made, largey based on the Cattpuccin Macchiato colors. It has minimal spacing between windows, and no spacing at all between between windows and the edge of the screen, as well as no rounded corners. It uses [Hyprpanel](https://github.com/Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel) as a status bar.
